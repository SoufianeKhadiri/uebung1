# Software Configuration Management
## Introduction
This project is about learning to collaborate in small groups on GitHub,
as well as testing the Java code with Junit.

## Implementation
Three classes were given, which had to be extended with some new classes and methods. 
In our case, we extended the class “Drinks” with a subclass “Coffee”,
than we added some new attributes to the subclass (“intensity” and “origin”) as well as the associated 
 
### constructors and getter/setter methods.
From this class we added again two subclasses that reflect flavors of coffee (“CoffeeWithMilk” and “CoffeWithAclohol”). 
These also got new attributes (“hasAlcohol”, “alcoholType” and milkType respectively),
and again the associated constructors and methods were added.
